<h2>Specification Agreements</h2>
<p><strong>Using the Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a version of the specification that you consider to be
final, contributors and others who are interested should sign the
<a href="http://openwebfoundation.org/legal/agreement/">Open Web Foundation
Agreement</a> for that
version of the specification. Each individual or company will need to
fill in the agreement in order to make it specific to the
specification and it's current version number. You'll then want to
provide copies of all signed agreements for the specification online
for anyone to see.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Agreement</strong></p>
<p>You Give Everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a free license to use the copyrights in your contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>free rights to use your necessary patent claims in order to implement the
  specification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You and the Community are free:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to Share - to copy and distribute the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Revise - to make new versions of the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Implement - to use the signatories' necessary patent claims to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute any
  implementation of the covered specification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Revise the specification - If you make new versions of the specification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you must include attribution to the original specification (but
  not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use
  of the work).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you don't get any rights under the agreement to anything new
  that you add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you must maintain the required portions of the original
  specification if you want to continue to take advantage of the
  patent grant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Defensive Legal Action - If you take non-defensive patent legal
  action against another implementer of the same specification, you
  lose any rights you received for the same specification under the
  agreement from everyone who signed the agreement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
