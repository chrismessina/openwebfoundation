Open Web Foundation Agreement Deed
==================================


How it Works
------------

When you start work on developing a specification, you should have the
participants sign the appropriate Contributor License Agreement
(pending). Once you have a version of the specification that you
consider final, contributors and others who are interested should sign
the [Open Web Foundation
Agreement](http://openwebfoundation.org/legal/agreement/) for that
version of the specification.


What You Give and What You and the Community Get Under the Agreement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### You Give Everyone:

- __Copyright__ - a free license to use the copyrights in your
  contributions.

- __Patent__ - free rights to use your necessary patent claims to
  implement the specification.


### You and the Community are free:

- __to Share__ - to copy and distribute the specification.

- __to Rev the Specification__ - to make new versions of the
  specification.

- __to Implement__ - to use the signatories' necessary patent claims
  to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute any
  implementation of the covered specification.

### Under the following conditions:

- __Rev the Specification__ - If you make new versions of the
  specification you must include attribution to the original
  specification (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse
  you or your use of the work).  You don't get any rights under the
  agreement to anything new that you add.  You must maintain the
  required portions of the original specification if you want to
  continue to take advantage of the patent grant.

- __Non-Defensive Legal Action__ - If you take non-defensive patent
  legal action against another implementer of the same specification,
  you lose any rights you received for the same specification under
  the agreement from everyone who signed the agreement.

A Few More Notes
----------------

- __This is not the actual agreement.__ This document is not a
  license. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the [Open
  Web Foundation
  Agreement](http://openwebfoundation.org/legal/agreement/) -- it is a
  human-readable expression of some of its key terms. This document
  itself has no legal value, and its contents do not appear in the
  actual agreement. Please read the actual agreement.

- __We're not a law firm.__ The Open Web Foundation is not a law firm
  and does not provide legal services. Distributing of, displaying of,
  or linking to this document does not create an attorney-client
  relationship.
