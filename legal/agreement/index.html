<h2>Open Web Foundation Agreement Version 0.9</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>The Purpose of this Agreement.</em> This Agreement sets forth the
terms under which I make certain copyright and patent rights available
to you for your Implementation of the Specification.  Capitalized
terms are defined in the Agreement's last section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Copyright.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Copyright Grant.</em> I grant to you a perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation
for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and
implement the Specification to the full extent of my copyright
interest in the Specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attribution.</em> As a condition of the copyright grant, you
must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative
work you make based on the Specification.  That attribution must
include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Patents.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Patent Non-Assert.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>The Promise.</em> I, on behalf of myself and my successors in
interest and assigns, irrevocably promise not to assert my
Necessary Claims against you for your Implementation, subject
to the following.  This is a personal promise directly from me
to you, and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from
it that no rights from me are received from suppliers,
distributors, or otherwise in connection with this promise.
This promise also applies to your making, using, selling,
offering for sale, importing or distributing an implementation
of any subsequent derivative works incorporating the
Specification 1) only to the extent that it implements the
Specification, and 2) so long as all required portions of the
Specification are implemented.  This promise does not extend
to any portion of the derivative work that was not included in
the Specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Termination.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>As a Result of Claims by You.</em> All rights, grants, and
promises made by me to you under this Agreement are
terminated if you file, maintain, or voluntarily
participate in a lawsuit against me or any person or
entity asserting that its Implementation infringes your
Necessary Claims, unless that suit was in response to a
corresponding suit first brought against you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As Result of Claims by a Related Entity.</em> If a Related
Entity of mine files, maintains, or voluntarily
participates in a lawsuit asserting that an Implementation
infringes its Necessary Claims, then I relinquish any
rights, grants, and promises I have received for the
Specification from other signatories of this Agreement,
unless a) my promise to you was terminated pursuant to
section 3.1.2.1, or b) that suit was in response to a
corresponding suit first brought by you against the
Related Entity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Additional Conditions.</em> This promise is not an assurance
(i) that any of my copyrights or issued patent claims covers
an Implementation or are enforceable or (ii) that an
Implementation would not infringe intellectual property rights
of any third party.  Notwithstanding the personal nature of my
promise, this promise is intended to be binding on any future
owner, assignee or exclusive licensee who has been given the
right to enforce any Necessary Claims against third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bankruptcy.</em> Solely for purposes of Section 365(n) of
Title 11, United States Bankruptcy Code and any equivalent law
in any foreign jurisdiction, this promise will be treated as
if it were a license and you may elect to retain your rights
under this promise if I (or any owner of any patents or patent
applications referenced herein), as a debtor in possession, or
a bankruptcy trustee, reject this non-assert.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Patent License Commitment.</em> In addition to rights granted in
3.1, on behalf of me and my successors in interest and assigns, I
agree to grant to you a no charge, royalty free license to my
Necessary Claims on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms solely
for your Implementation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Good Faith Obligation.</em> I agree that I have not and will not
knowingly take any action for the purpose of circumventing my
obligations under this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Disclaimers.</em> THIS SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS."  I expressly
disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including
implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a
particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification.  The
entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification is
assumed by the Specification implementer and user.  IN NO EVENT WILL
ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  All of my obligations
under Section 3 regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or
assignment of Necessary Claims will be satisfied if I notify the
transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Necessary
Claims of the obligations under Section 3.  Nothing in this Agreement
requires me to undertake a patent search.</p>
